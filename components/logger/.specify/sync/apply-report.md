# Sync Apply Report

Applied: 2026-05-21

## Changes Made

### Specs Updated (BACKFILL)

| Spec | Section | Change |
|------|---------|--------|
| `specs/001-logger-component/spec.md` | FR-001, User Stories, Key Entities | Replaced all occurrences of `LoggerComponentV1` with `LoggerComponent` |

### Summary

FR-001 previously specified the component name as `LoggerComponentV1`. The code uses `LoggerComponent` (V1 suffix removed during a codebase-wide naming cleanup). Since only one version exists and the rename was intentional, the spec was updated to match the code.

Occurrences updated:
- FR-001 requirement text
- User Story 1 (description, test, acceptance scenarios)
- User Story 2 (description, test, acceptance scenarios)
- User Story 3 (description, test, acceptance scenarios)
- Key Entities section (LoggerComponent entry)

### Verification

- No code changes required (spec-only backfill)
- Component name in code (`LoggerComponent`) is unchanged
- All other requirements (FR-002 through FR-014, SC-001 through SC-007) remain aligned

## Next Steps

1. Review the spec changes: `git diff components/logger/specs/`
2. Commit when ready
